Dr. Haoming Ma is a **staff scientist** and **principal investigator** at the Hydrogen Energy Research Center of the **University of Wyoming** [School of Energy Resources](https://www.uwyo.edu/ser). Prior to that, he was a **post‑doctoral fellow** in the [Center for Energy & Environmental Systems Analysis](https://www.ceesa.utexas.edu) and the [Energy Emissions Modeling & Data Lab](https://www.eemdl.utexas.edu/) at the **University of Texas at Austin** Hildebrand Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering, working with Prof. [Arvind P. Ravikumar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JgkvadQAAAAJ&hl=en).

Dr. Ma received his **Ph.D.** in [Chemical and Petroleum Engineering](https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/chemical-petroleum/home) from the **University of Calgary** in 2023, advised by Profs. [Zhangxin Chen](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=LWXGc90AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Sean T. McCoy](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=puoY4D8AAAAJ&hl=en). He holds an **M.Sc.** in Computer and Information Technology from the **University of Pennsylvania** and an **M.Sc.** in Energy Policy and Management from [Department of Energy and Mineral Engineering](https://www.eme.psu.edu/) at the **Penn State University**, where he also completed his **B.Sc.** in Energy Engineering with two minors in Energy Business & Finance and Environmental Engineering.

Toward a Secure, Affordable, and Sustainable Geo‑Energy Future
======
Dr. Ma's research interest lies in developing **AI‑enabled system‑analysis toolkits**  that integrate reservoir simulation, geostatistics, machine‑learning, multi‑scale emissions measurement data, and techno‑economic & life cycle assessment (TEA/LCA) to understand the technological, economic, and environmental **trade‑offs** for geo‑energy systems.

He is particularly interested in three areas:

- Subsurface **CO₂** utilization associated with geological sequestration

- **Methane emissions** across oil‑and‑gas supply chains

- Subsurface **hydrogen** resources including extraction and storage

Through this interdisciplinary approach, he delivers technical, socioeconomic, and policy insights that advance a secure, affordable, and sustainable energy future.
